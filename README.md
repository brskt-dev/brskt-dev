### About Me

Fullstack Software Engineer experienced in building and evolving SaaS platforms using microservices architecture.

I work across backend (.NET), frontend (Angular), and infrastructure (Docker, CI/CD), focusing on domain modeling, API consistency, and production reliability.  

My approach connects technical decisions to product impact — prioritizing scalability, controlled system evolution, and long-term maintainability over short-term delivery speed.

Currently expanding my expertise in **Digital Product Management** to operate more effectively at the intersection of engineering, business strategy, and product growth.
